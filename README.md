### Run

If you have a running accessible cozy-stack you can test your the konnector without installing
and/or updating the konnector in the cozy-stack :

You first need an installed nodejs (LTS version is fine)

Then just run :

```sh
npm install
npm start
```
### Test

If you do not want to have to install the konnector on a cozy v3 to test it, you can register the
konnector as an OAuth application with the following commands :

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

This command will register your konnector as an OAuth application to the cozy-stack. By default,
the cozy-stack is supposed to be located in http://cozy.tools:8080. If this is not your case, just
update the COZY_URL field in ./data/env.js.

After that, your konnector is run but should not work since you did not specify an credentials to
the target service. You can also do this in ./data/env.js by modifying the COZY_FIELDS attribute
which is a JSON string.

Now run npm run dev one more time, you dont have to do the Oauth thing now, and it should be ok

### Hack

If you do not want to need to have an accessible cozy-stack, just run :

```sh
npm install
npm run standalone
```

The requests to the cozy stack will be stubbed using the ./data/fixture.json file as source of data
and when cozy-client-js is asked to create or update data, the data will be output to the console.
The bills (or any file) will be saved in the ./data directory
